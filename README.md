# Online resource for therapists using Web-CBT

Treatment manuals and other resources for therapists using the Web-CBT platform. The plan is to publish this as a separate site to provide therapists with easy access to support. We have a separate repository for materials related to the treatment platform itself, some of which we might not want to share openly due to IP rights. I hope, however, that these guides will be made openly available. /Oskar
