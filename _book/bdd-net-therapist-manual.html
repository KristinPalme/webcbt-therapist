<p><em>Detailed review of the content of the product. What therapeutic interventions are included and how are they implemented?</em></p>
<p>BDD-NET is a therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. BDD-NET has been evaluated in three clinical trials to date with results indicating that it is as effective as regular face-to-face CBT, while requiring less therapist time per patients and with the advantage of being accessible from any device connected to the internet <span class="citation">(Enander et al. 2014, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>BDD-NET consists of eight interactive modules and is based on a treatment protocol by Sabine Wilhelm and colleagues <span class="citation">(Wilhelm, Phillips, and Steketee 2013)</span> that focuses on exposure with response prevention. This means that patients do most of the active treatment work away from their computer or mobile device, for example when they are performing exposure and response prevention exercises.</p>
<p>In BDD-NET, therapists and patients communicate through asynchronous text messages (like e-mail or SMS) throughout treatment. The primary role of therapists is to provide support and feedback related to the treatment exercises.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Who is suitable for BDD-NET</h2>
<p><em>The clinical condition that the digital product has been developed for and the recommended range of symptom severities for patients using the digital product.</em></p>
<p>BDD-NET is developed to treat adults with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Patients may have comorbid conditions, for example other anxiety disorders, depression, or OCD. Patients may also take antidepressant medication during the course of treatment. We recommend that patients do not change the dose during the course of treatment. BDD-NET may also be delivered to patients with any level of BDD symptom severity.</p>
<p>Contraindications include having a personality disorder that might interfere with treatment (such as borderline personality disorder), psychotic symptoms, an ongoing substance abuse, or acute suicidal ideation. BDD-NET is text-based and so requires sufficient reading skills and understanding of English. We recommend that the patient is referred to face-to-face treatments if contraindications are discovered.</p>

<p><em>How to present the digital product to patients in a way that generates enthusiasm and ensures that the patient promptly starts using the product. Managing patients’ expectations of BDD-NET therapy</em></p>
<div id="assessing-insight" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Assessing insight</h3>
<p>Participating in internet-based treatments such as BDD-NET is voluntary, and therapists need to make sure that patients are willing to challenge their BDD in treatment. Lack of insight is common in BDD and BDD-NET is designed to work for patients that express varying degrees of insight. It is our experience that patients need to at least be willing to try out alternative behaviours during the course of treatment, even if they might still be convinced that their appearance concerns are justified at the start of treatment.</p>

<div id="managing-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Managing expectations</h3>
<p>Some patients may have expectations to be completely free from anxiety after BDD-NET, and that all that is required of them is to read and understand what is written in the treatment modules. Such expectations are discussed in module 4 (goal setting) but therapists are advised to assess whether patients are willing to challenge their BDD through exposure with response prevention and try out alternative behaviours before starting BDD-NET. If someone completely refuses to try new behaviours they are unlikely to participate in BDD-NET fully and benefit from the treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-good-start-in-bdd-net" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.3</span> A good start in BDD-NET</h3>
<p>Many patients with BDD find BDD-NET an interesting treatment option, particularly those who avoid many activities due to their appearance concerns. The strongest arguments in favour of ICBT treatments like BDD-NET, from a patient perspective, is that the treatment content and the therapist are accessible throughout the week, and that the treatment starts promptly after evaluation rather than after a time in waiting list.</p>
<p>To give patients a positive first impression of the treatment, we suggest that therapists write their first message on the first day of treatment to welcome the patient and notify them of ways to contact you. Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and establish a therapeutic working alliance. Patients sometimes struggle with crucial treatment components such as the BDD diary exposure with response prevention (EX/RP), so make sure to provide extra support if patients get stuck at those points.</p>

<p>As you can see, the emphasis is on doing exposure with response prevention (EX/RP), which we view as the main component of BDD-NET. You typically want to encourage the patient to progress through the first three modules as fast as possible, check that they have understood the rationale for EX/RP, and then start doing EX/RP. Once a patient is doing regular EX/RP-exercises, you can open up modules 6-7 for them to complete while continuing to do daily EX/RP. Module 8 can then be opened up with one to two weeks left in treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="being-an-effective-icbt-therapist-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Being an effective ICBT therapist</h2>
<p>Being a therapist in BDD-NET differs in several ways from regular face-to-face treatment. The first difference is the mode of communication: asynchronous text messages rather than live face-to-face talking. The second is that you are more closely integrated in the treatment content, and will rely more heavily on material that is already written. Third, there is less therapist oversight when patients do exposure exercises. We discuss the implications of these differences, and some strategies to have in mind, below.</p>
<div id="communicating-through-written-messages-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1</span> Communicating through written messages</h3>
<p><em>What to include in support messages and frequency of communication. Common problems with supporting messages.</em></p>
<p>We recommend that most messages are short and follow the structure of topic sentence, body, and conclusion. In the topic sentence, you describe the content of your message. The body text can then expand on certain things that you want to achieve, for example giving feedback or providing encouragement after the patient reports an EX/RP exercise, or helping the patient understand a treatment concept they struggle with. In the conclusion, you restate your main message from the topic sentence and can choose to end with a call to action or a question.</p>
<p>From the participant’s point of view, your messages will look like text messages on a phone. This is deliberate, as such a design encourages short and frequent messages rather than long messages that are few and far between.</p>
<div id="keep-your-messages-short-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1.1</span> Keep your messages short</h4>
<p>Messages should be concise and to the point. Refer the patient to module text whenever possible. Your main use of the messages should be to provide encouragement and reinforce key behaviours such as registering in the BDD diary and performing EX/RP exercises. To this end, you can allow yourself longer messages related to the BDD diary where you highlight examples that the patient has given and relate them to the CBT model of BDD. One common strategy to reinforce EX/RP exercises is to connect them to the long-term goals that the patient has decided on.</p>
</div>
<div id="write-often-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1.2</span> Write often</h4>
<p>Frequent communication is particularly useful at the start of treatment and when patients start doing EX/RP exercises. This establishes the habit of logging onto the platform daily, and ensures that patients start doing EX/RP which is challenging and likely to be avoided without your encouragement.</p>
<p>As a minimum, therapists should write to patients once every 2-3 days to check in, but several messages per day can be useful when patients start doing EX/RP. For example, you may confirm an exposure exercise in the morning and check in during the afternoon for a follow-up. There are exceptions to this rule: some patients will prefer to do EX/RP on their own and will not have many questions for you. This is perfectly fine; some patients benefit greatly from the BDD-NET content without the therapist support.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="you-and-the-rest-of-the-content-in-bdd-net" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.2</span> You and the rest of the content in BDD-NET</h3>
<p>Your communication with the patient is integrated with the rest of BDD-NET. What feels like a low-intensity contact from your perspective is actually a <strong>highly intensive treatment</strong> for patients. They not only respond to your messages but also read module texts, answer homework questions and questionnaires, and fill in worksheets. The treatment becomes particularly intensive once patients start performing daily EX/RP exercises. Do not be fooled by the seemingly low-intensity treatment from your point of view; BDD-NET is a highly intensive treatment for patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-therapist-guided-exposure-exercises-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.3</span> Lack of therapist-guided exposure exercises</h3>
<p>We do not have the privilege of guiding patients through EX/RP exercises in BDD-NET. This means that you will have to focus on the essentials when giving corrective feedback and when planning EX/RP exercises. Correcting every little detail before each exercise is counter-productive. Rather, we want to reinforce the behaviour of challenging their BDD through EX/RP exercises. BDD-NET therapists should therefore encourage patients to get started and gain new experiences. Wrinkles can be ironed out along the way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="common-issues" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Common issues</h2>
<p>We list common issues and suggest strategies for dealing with them below. You can view these as starting points and we encourage you to adapt these strategies when necessary. Discussions with colleagues and supervision are (as always) helpful strategies.</p>
<div id="lack-of-space-to-address-questions-through-messages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.1</span> Lack of space to address questions through messages</h3>
<p>Starting out as a therapist in BDD-NET can be frustrating if you want to address every question and issue that patients report.</p>
<p><strong>IDEAS:</strong>
* Focus on one thing per message
* Rely on the written material, common questions are most likely addressed in one of the modules
* Whenever possible, turn it into an exercise that the patient can try out for themselves. Maybe it’s suitable for cognitive restructuring, maybe an EX/RP exercise.
* You can also defer some common issues to module 7 if it’s included there.
* We have to accept that we do not have fine grained control over the patient’s understanding. Maybe that’s OK as long as they do EX/RP exercises, then you can steer the patient toward exercises that might resolve a misunderstanding</p>
</div>
<div id="reinforcing-rumination-instead-of-behaviour-change" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2</span> Reinforcing rumination instead of behaviour change</h3>
<p>You can avoid reinforcing the wrong behaviour by thinking about what you attend to in your responses to patients. A typical message from a patient mid-treatment might include a summary of their latest EX/RP, comments about what they have found challenging, and a couple of questions about the treatment content. It is very tempting to try to answer the questions and make suggestions for how to deal with the challenges in your response, but that is not really what we want to reinforce here. Rather, we want to encourage the patient to continue doing EX/RP because that is the key behaviour for them to get better in the long-term.</p>
<p><strong>IDEAS:</strong>
* Maybe it’s already discussed in the “common difficulties” module, then open up that one
* Maybe you can recommend a certain EX/RP exercise for the patient to try and see whether that resolves their question
* Maybe it’s lack of clarity in the EX/RP exercise and you need to revisit the plan, make some changes, and then try again
* We don’t want to reinforce rumination over challenges but rather the patient’s ability to do hands-on exercises and adjust them over time</p>
</div>
<div id="dealing-with-low-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.3</span> Dealing with low engagement</h3>
<p>The best way to deal with low engagement is to prevent it from happening to begin with. Strategies to prevent low engagement include writing frequently and focusing on encouragement in your written messages, promptly calling patients that do not respond to messages, and helping patients design their first EX/RP exercises to get early experiences of the treatment procedures in action.</p>
<p>If a patient becomes less active on the treatment platform, it does not necessarily mean that they are not actively working with the treatment or have given up on the treatment. Some inactive patients are actually doing a lot of treatment work in their daily life but do not report it. Others are early responders that have grasped the treatment strategies quickly and experienced symptom reductions early in treatment. Even with these exceptions, there are certainly occasions when a patient struggles to adhere to the treatment.</p>
<div id="i-dont-have-time-to-work-on-the-treatment" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.7.3.1</span> “I don’t have time to work on the treatment”</h4>
<p>One common reason for low engagement is that patients struggle to find the time to work on BDD-NET. We recommend that you encourage any small steps the patient takes and that you prioritise EX/RP exercises away from the computer over reading additional modules.</p>
<p>If a patient is completely unable to work on the treatment, try to schedule a point to check back in to resume treatment or help the patient problem-solve around other events that may interfere with working on the treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="skepticism-about-bdd-net" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.7.3.2</span> Skepticism about BDD-NET</h4>
<p>Some patients may initially be skeptical about BDD-NET in general or in their ability to do a fully remote treatment like BDD-NET. We recommend that therapists validate the feelings of frustration that can come from any attempt to change behaviour, and that therapists note that this as a common feeling early in treatment. Initially skeptical patients often change their opinion after doing EX/RP exercises that work, and we encourage therapists to help these patients experience <em>early wins</em> by starting with easier EX/RP exercises that have a high likelihood of success.</p>
